# Shrouded Ledger Episode Outline – Hush Pulse Initiative

## Logline
_TODO: One or two sentences capturing the core anomaly, its impact on the community, and the investigative angle._

## Beats
1. Opening macro view – how the audience first encounters the anomaly.
2. Early history/origins – how this started or entered public awareness.
3. Micro-case 1 – a specific person, location, or facility.
4. Micro-case 2 – another angle showing the anomaly's reach.
5. Micro-case 3 (optional) – escalation or contradiction.
6. Institutional response – attempts to suppress, contain, monetize, or deny.
7. Evidence of cover-up – edits to records, missing people, altered reports.
8. Current state of the anomaly – how it now lives in infrastructure or memory.
9. Consequences – personal, social, geopolitical, psychological.
10. Closing image – a specific, chilling image that implies the story isn't over.

## Notes
- Maintain documentary, forensic tone.
- Show behavior and evidence; do not label emotions directly.
