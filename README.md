# AI Learning Journey — Creative Automation Toolkit

This repository documents my personal journey into AI development, Python tooling, and creative automation.  
It contains a growing suite of **command-line tools** designed to streamline the production of:

- **Shrouded Ledger** documentary-style horror episodes  
- **Aperture Black** liminal/analog visual videos  
- **Novel and short fiction projects**  
- General writing and content creation workflows  

The aim of this project is twofold:

1. **Build real, concrete technical skills** through hands-on Python development.  
2. **Automate 80–90% of the repetitive work** involved in creative production, while keeping the core artistic decisions in human hands.

This repository grows daily as I learn new tools, patterns, and techniques.
